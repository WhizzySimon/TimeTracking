Read:

- Docs/INDEX.md
- AGENTS.md
- .windsurf/cascade.md
- Docs/Guidelines/IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFICATION_RULES.md
- Docs/Tooling/BOOTSTRAP.md (tooling entry point — includes watcher + git workflow)
- Docs/Devlog/LEARNINGS.md (proven preferences — read at session start)

## Health Checks (run after reading docs)

1. **Check current branch:** Ensure on `dev` branch (see `Docs/Tooling/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`)

If not on dev, switch to dev before starting new work.

Return only a single line:
"Read governance docs, [z]k context tokens"
