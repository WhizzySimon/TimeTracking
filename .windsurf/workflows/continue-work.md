Run these workflows first:

1. /rules-read-all
2. /read-governance
3. /read-core-docs-and-code

Then:

4. Read `Docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` to find current phase and completed tasks
5. Read `Docs/Tasks/timetracker-v1-implementation.md` to find the next incomplete task
6. Start implementing the next task following the Automated Task Workflow from COMMAND_EXECUTION_RULES.md

Report:
- Current phase
- Next task to implement
- Begin implementation immediately
