# Update button appears when no update available

**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Type:** [x] Bug

## Current Behavior
The "Update verfügbar - Neuladen" button appears on every page even when the latest version is already loaded. Clicking it reloads the page but nothing changes because the same version is already active.

## Desired Behavior
The update button should only appear when there is actually an older version loaded and a newer version is available.
