## Hard Rules (enforce in .windsurf/rules/ or AGENTS.md)

- **[Hard Rule]** Never use `git stash` — causes data loss. Use WIP commits instead.
  - Because: Multiple incidents of lost work. See GIT_WORKFLOW.md.
- **[Hard Rule]** Use `&&` not `;` for watcher command chaining.
  - Because: Watcher executes via cmd.exe, which uses `&&` (not PowerShell's `;`).

## Preferences

- **[Preference]** Prefer minimal upstream fixes over downstream workarounds.
  - Because: Root cause fixes prevent repeat issues.

## Reminders
