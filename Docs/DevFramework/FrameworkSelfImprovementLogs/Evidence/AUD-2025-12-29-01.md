## Research Summary

**Question:** How to assure code quality for LLM-generated code, specifically around hardcoded URLs and paths?

**Sources consulted:**
- SPK & Associates: Best Practices for Reviewing and Auditing LLM-Generated Code
- arXiv: Quality Assurance of LLM-generated Code: Addressing Non-Functional Quality Characteristics

**Key findings:**
1. LLMs often generate hardcoded credentials, secrets, and URLs
2. Static analysis should catch these patterns but LLMs need explicit guidance
3. Environment variables should externalize configuration
4. "Magic numbers" and "hard-coded values" are code smells

**Options considered:**
1. Static analysis only — rejected (LLM needs explicit written rules)
2. ESLint rules only — rejected (doesn't cover all cases)
3. **Document explicit rules in code-quality.md** — chosen (provides clear guidance)
