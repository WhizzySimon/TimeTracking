# P08 — Code Quality Package

**Created:** 2025-12-24  
**Type:** Meta-task (docs-only)  
**Status:** In Progress

---

## JIT Rules (MANDATORY)

**Follow the JIT rule map at each trigger point:** `Docs/DevFramework/Rules/_entrypoint-jit-rule-map.md`

Key triggers during task execution: writing code, before commit, session end.

---

## Goal

Produce a complete docs-only "Code Quality" package:

- Audit report (read-only)
- Code Quality Standard (v1)
- SDD integration docs (spec/plan/tasks for future enforcement)
- Update doc index to link everything

**Constraints:** No refactoring, no behavior changes, no tooling changes in this run.

---

## Deliverables

1. `Docs/Reports/code-quality-style-audit.md` — Tooling inventory + evidence-based hotspots
2. `Docs/Standards/code-quality-standard.md` — The v1 standard (verbatim)
3. `Docs/Specs/P08-code-quality.md` — Spec for future enforcement work
4. `Docs/Plans/P08-code-quality.md` — Plan for future enforcement work
5. `Docs/Tasks/P08-code-quality.md` — Tasks for future enforcement work
6. Update `Docs/INDEX.md` — Link all new docs
