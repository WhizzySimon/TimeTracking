## Summary

- **Pass rate:** 3/3 (100% of attempted)
- **Time efficiency:** 40min expected / ~5min actual = 800%
- **Regressions detected:** None

## Evaluation

The benchmark system works but reveals a problem:

1. **Easy tasks are trivial** — GT-01 to GT-03 completed in <2min each vs 10-15min expected
2. **No real regression detection** — Tasks are too generic to catch framework-specific issues
3. **Overhead vs value unclear** — Running 10 tasks manually after every restructure is time-consuming

**Recommendation:** Keep the benchmark concept but consider:

- Automating some tasks as actual tests
- Making tasks more specific to TimeTracker
- Only running after major changes, not routinely
