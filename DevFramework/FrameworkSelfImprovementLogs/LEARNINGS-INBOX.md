| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 2025-12-30 | UI design thinking | CORRECTIVE: Badge placed below category name, causing vertical expansion. User: "we have a lot of space to the right for the whole row." Lesson: **Think like a UI designer** - consider horizontal vs vertical space usage, avoid unnecessary row height increases, use inline positioning when horizontal space is available. Always consider layout impact before implementation.                   | Pending                      |
| 2025-12-30 | Proactive testing  | POSITIVE (BEHAVIORAL): Added "Self-Learning System Test Result" section to task completion summary, showing Step 0 multi-commit protection worked. User: "I am positively surprised and I want you to encourage to keep doing that." This aligns with mindset.md proactive behavior - test new systems and report results without being asked.                                                         | Pending                      |
| 2025-12-30 | UX requirements    | CORRECTIVE: User clarified badge requirement mid-implementation: "just put a badge to Nicht-Arbeitszeit, which is called now Abwesenheit, and make it just with a grey background." Original plan had badges for both work/non-work categories with different colors. Lesson: When user provides specific UI direction, follow exactly - don't add "improvements" they didn't ask for.                 | Pending                      |
| 2025-12-30 | Proactive behavior | POSITIVE (BEHAVIORAL): When user questions QA coverage ("did you test the UI?"), responded proactively: showed verification table, ran browser tests, proposed and created `/bugfix` workflow improvement. This is good "employee behavior" — taking a simple question as opportunity to improve, not just answer. **Meta-question:** How to make AI remember this disposition? See analysis in chat.  | Pending                      |
| 2025-12-29 | Pre-commit gate    | CORRECTIVE: User noted that audit summary and pre-commit checklist were scattered in output, not visible as a clear gate before commit. **5th pre-commit violation.** FIX: Added "Final Verification Gate" section to pre-commit.md requiring a single, visually distinct block with all summaries before committing.                                                                                  | → Addressed in pre-commit.md |
| 2025-12-29 | Task completion    | POSITIVE: User requested that task completion summaries include "Pre-commit checklist: PASS" as a bullet in the Verification section, after Audit. Format: `- **Pre-commit checklist: PASS** (all 7 steps executed)`. Makes verification trail visible.                                                                                                                                                | Pending                      |
| 2025-12-29 | Pre-commit skip    | CORRECTIVE: Read pre-commit.md and saw checklist including "Self-learning & improvement" step, but skipped it and jumped to Evidence Bundle creation. Handed off to /audit without completing all checklist items. **4th violation of pre-commit workflow.** Root cause: checklist items read but not executed sequentially.                                                                           | Pending                      |
| 2025-12-28 | JIT rule map       | PROCESS: When discussing rules/process, demonstrated learning by asking user before committing instead of just committing. Shows active listening. Key insight: JIT rule map should be SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH - don't duplicate specific rules in templates, just reference JIT rule map. Prevents rule sprawl and keeps maintenance simple.                                                           | Pending                      |
| 2025-12-28 | Windsurf hooks     | TECHNICAL: On Windows, Windsurf hooks don't default to workspace root as cwd. Use explicit `working_directory` with absolute path + relative `command`. Tested: relative-only fails, absolute works, relative+working_directory works.                                                                                                                                                                 | Pending                      |
| 2025-12-28 | Progress tracker   | CORRECTIVE: When audit added Phase 0 tasks to Tasks file, forgot to update IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md. Progress tracker showed D5 as COMPLETE when it wasn't. Added explicit checklist item to pre-commit.md.                                                                                                                                                                                          | Pending                      |
| 2025-12-28 | Meta: AI behavior  | META-INSIGHT: AI tends to create avoidance rules after failures ("don't click X") instead of questioning assumptions or understanding systems deeper. Like old people who accumulate so many rules they stop leaving the house. The solution isn't more rules - it's "looking out of the box", questioning the system, understanding WHY something behaves unexpectedly. Don't just avoid; understand. | → Promoted 2025-12-29        |
| 2025-12-27 | run_command use    | CORRECTIVE: Used `run_command` tool instead of Cascade Watcher. User reminded again. Must read `DevFramework/ToolSetup                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Framework/JustInTimeAgentRules/command-execution.md`before any command. JIT trigger not followed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Pending           |
| 2025-12-27 | Pre-commit skip   | CORRECTIVE: Skipped pre-commit.md trigger before`git commit`. Just-in-time rules only work if I READ them at the trigger point. **3rd violation.** FIX: D5 restructured to single always-on.md → jit-rule-map.md chain.                                                                                                                                                                               | → Addressed by D5 |
| 2025-12-27 | Lint fix loop     | CORRECTIVE: When lint rule rejects multiple fix attempts, STOP and analyze: (1) Why does the rule exist? (2) Is the implementation pattern correct? (3) Research community solutions. Don't iterate on syntax - understand the problem first.                                                                                                                                                          | Pending           |
| 2025-12-27 | D4 cleanup        | CORRECTIVE: Forgot to delete AGENTS.md after test PASS. Said "can delete later" but didn't. When task has "do X after Y passes", execute immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Pending           |
| 2025-12-27 | Watcher fix       | BUG FIX: PowerShell's Start-Process doesn't populate ExitCode immediately after HasExited. Must call $process.WaitForExit() first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Pending           |
| 2025-12-27 | Versioning        | CORRECTIVE: Forgot session-end rules (CHANGELOG, DECISIONS, LEARNINGS) until user reminded. Need to internalize this as automatic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Pending           |
| 2025-12-27 | Watcher           | BUG: Watcher shows DONE:FAILED with empty exit code for ALL commands, even successful ones. Output shows real result. Watcher exit code capture is broken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Pending           |
| 2025-12-27 | Versioning        | Netlify does shallow clones without tags. Need `git fetch --tags`before`git describe`for CI/CD environments. | Pending |
| 2025-12-26 | A1 spec phase | POSITIVE: User praised analysis of P10 conflicts and clarifying questions before spec creation. "Awesome analysis, very good findings, thanks for coming back with the questions." | Pending |
| 2025-12-26 | A1 spec phase | POSITIVE: User reminded to commit docs before starting implementation. Good practice to checkpoint work. | Pending |
| 2026-01-01 | Email change flow | CORRECTIVE (3x FAILURE): Supabase email change confirmation not working after 3 attempts. Issues: (1) Assumed`detectSessionInUrl` handles email_change tokens - it doesn't, (2) Assumed token is in query params - may be in hash fragment, (3) Didn't test with Playwright before claiming fix. **LESSON:** For auth flows involving external services (Supabase), MUST use Playwright to verify the actual URL format and token handling before claiming fix. Don't assume - observe actual behavior. | Pending |
| 2026-01-01 | Debugging mindset | CORRECTIVE (5x trial-and-error loop): Email change bug required 5 hypothesis-test cycles before finding root cause (Supabase "Secure Email Change" requires confirmation from BOTH old and new email). Each cycle involved code changes and user actions. **ROOT CAUSE OF APPROACH:** Stopped investigating at first plausible explanation instead of mapping the full system. **LESSON:** Don't stop at first plausible cause. Map the full system of parameters/dependencies before acting. Balance: don't go infinitely deep, but don't act on first hypothesis either. Investigate until confident in the full picture. This wastes less time than trial-and-error loops, especially when user actions are involved. | → Promoted to mindset.md, debugging.md |
| 2026-01-02 | Panic-close UX | POSITIVE (BEHAVIORAL): User explained why X button needed in top-right corner: "For any kind of panic. He just wants out there. He doesn't want to read anything or understand anything just out close." This is standard UI convention. Users may be overwhelmed, confused, or simply want immediate escape without reading button labels. The X is universally understood as "close this now." **LESSON:** UI elements serve psychological needs, not just functional ones. Panic-close is about user comfort and control. | Pending |
| 2026-01-02 | Proactive behavior (3x) | POSITIVE (BEHAVIORAL, REPEATED): User praised proactive behavior 3 times in one session: (1) "you're very proactive. I like that" after creating ProjectSpecific/testing.md + JIT trigger without being asked, (2) "Again, you're very proactive" after proposing Docs folder analysis, (3) "Maybe that's worth to note" suggesting self-learning capture. **Pattern confirmed:** When noticing a gap, propose the solution AND implement it. Don't just answer — improve the system. | → Promoted to LEARNINGS.md + mindset.md |
| 2026-01-02 | Self-documenting principle | INSIGHT (SYSTEMIC): Documentation about a system is never the source of truth — the system itself is. In the age of AI, live analysis replaces static docs. Therefore: (1) Archive stale documentation about systems, (2) Make systems self-documenting via naming/structure, (3) The UI is its own documentation. Applied: archived DeveloperGuidesAndStandards/, added Self-Documenting UI rule to frontend-ux-standards.md, naming-conventions.md already had the principle. | → Promoted to LEARNINGS.md |
| 2026-01-02 | Irritation as signal | INSIGHT (META): User described how human brain notices issues: "I'm irritated when something is not fully logic." This irritation IS the signal that something's wrong. Don't suppress it — investigate. Applied: Added "Irritation as Signal" section to mindset.md. | → Promoted to LEARNINGS.md + mindset.md |
| 2026-01-02 | Ultimate goal: automate + quality | INSIGHT (FRAMEWORK): The goal is not just automation but automation WITH quality. AI strengths: speed, logic. Human strengths: self-learning, zoom-out, quality judgment. The framework exists to give AI the human strengths. Applied: Created framework-principles.md with full rationale. | → Promoted to LEARNINGS.md + framework-principles.md |
| 2026-01-02 | Recursive self-improvement | INSIGHT (META): Not just "zoom out" but observe THAT you're zooming out. Document the meta-observation. Ask: "What triggered this improvement? Can we automate the trigger?" Goal: Each improvement happens automatically next time. Applied: Added to framework-principles.md "Recursive Self-Improvement" section. | → Applied to framework-principles.md |
| 2026-01-02 | Quality over haste | CORRECTIVE (SELF-OBSERVED): After user's large prompt, rushed to summarize and said "Ready for next task" — missed ~50% of insights. User had to prompt twice for full extraction. **LESSON:** Quality > speed. After substantial input: re-read, enumerate extractions, verify completeness before summarizing. Taking 2 min longer beats missing half the value. | → Promoted to LEARNINGS.md + mindset.md |
| 2026-01-02 | Reframe "irritation" for AI | CORRECTIVE: User asked if AI can "feel irritation" — answer is no. Reframed as "Inconsistency Detection" with concrete checklist AI CAN apply: naming mismatches, unexplained complexity, redundancy, friction, self-documentation failures. These are detectable signals, not feelings. | → Applied to mindset.md, updated LEARNINGS.md |
| 2026-01-02 | Translate human concepts | INSIGHT (META): When receiving human concepts (irritation, intuition, gut feel), don't transcribe — translate. Extract the FUNCTION the concept serves, then design an AI-executable equivalent. "Extraction mode" without evaluation caused this miss. | → Promoted to LEARNINGS.md + mindset.md + framework-principles.md |
| 2026-01-02 | Mindset is permanent overlay | INSIGHT (META): Mindset rules aren't just triggered at task start — they're a PERMANENT OVERLAY on all work. Even in "extraction mode", mindset principles (evaluate, don't just capture) still apply. Forgetting this caused the "transcribe without translate" error. | → Promoted to LEARNINGS.md + mindset.md header |
| 2026-01-02 | Ultimate goal + creativity | FOUNDATIONAL: Everything derives from one goal: **Improve quality AND save human time.** AI's job is to constantly ask: "What can I create that hasn't existed? What can I improve?" This is creativity with purpose — not creativity for its own sake, but directed at the ultimate goal. Don't just execute tasks; continuously look for inefficiencies, quality gaps, patterns that could become rules. **This IS the work.** | → Promoted to LEARNINGS.md (Foundational Principle) + framework-principles.md |
