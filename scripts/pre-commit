# Pre-commit hook: auto-increment version and regenerate sw.js
# This runs before every commit to ensure version changes with each commit

# Run the version update script
node scripts/update-version.js

# Note: version.json and sw.js are in .gitignore
# They are generated at build time, not committed
# The pre-commit hook just ensures they exist locally for development
